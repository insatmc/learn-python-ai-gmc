# Python
Python is a “high-level programming language and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code” created by Guido van Rossum.

In this course we will use an online code editor so no installation required.

## Hello World
In our academy page, switch to code view and type
```python
print("Hello Python!")
```

## The Basics
### Variables
You can think about variables as a word that stores a value. Simple as that.

```python
# booleans
true_boolean = True # T (uppercase) not t!
false_boolean = False # F not f!

# string
my_name = "Leandro Tk"

# float
book_price = 15.80
```


### Control Flow: conditional statements
If something is True do something otherwise do something else.

```python
if 1 > 2:
  print("1 is greater than 2")
else:
  print("1 is not greater than 2")
```

You can also use “elif” statement. Like that:

```python
if 1 > 2:
  print("1 is greater than 2")
elif 2 > 1:
  print("1 is not greater than 2")
else:
  print("1 is equal to 2")
```

### Looping
Do something until some condition turn to False
```python
num = 1

while num <= 10:
  print(num)
  num += 1
```

For each element of a list do something
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
  print(i)
```

### Exercise
Ask the user to enter two integers (x and y) both should be greater than 0.
Print which integer is bigger x or y.

// slide 3
## Data Structures
### List: Collection | Array
```python
my_integers = [5, 7, 3, 4, 4]
```

To do something with one element of the array we use indexes like this
```python
print(my_integers[0]) # 5
print(my_integers[1] + my_integers[4]) # 7 + 4 = 11
```

To add an element to our list we use append()
```python
bookshelf = []
bookshelf.append("The Effective Engineer")
bookshelf.append("The 4 Hour Work Week")
print(bookshelf[0]) # The Effective Engineer
print(bookshelf[1]) # The 4 Hour Work Week
```

### Tuples
Lists that cannot be changed, just another thing () in place of [].

```python
  a = (1, 2, "string", [])
  print(a[2])
```

### Dictionary: Key-Value Data Structure
```python
dictionary_example = {
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3"
}
```

Now we can do something with an element of our Dictionary using it's key:
```Python
print("My name is %s" %(dictionary_tk["name"])) # My name is Leandro
```

### Looping a Dictionary
```python
for key, value in dictionary.items():
    print("%s --> %s" %(key, value))
```

### Exercise:
Create a French to English Translator.

### Functions
```python
def sum_of_2(arg1, arg2):
  result = arg1 * arg2
  return result

res = sum_of_2(2, 3)
print(res)
```

### OOP
```python
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, number_of_wheels, type_of_tank, seating_capacity, maximum_velocity):
    self.number_of_wheels = number_of_wheels
    self.type_of_tank = type_of_tank
    self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity
    self.maximum_velocity = maximum_velocity

  def number_of_wheels(self):
    return self.number_of_wheels

  def set_number_of_wheels(self, number):
    self.number_of_wheels = number

  def make_noise(self):
    print('VRUUUUUUUM')
```

Using this class
```python
tesla_model_s = Vehicle(4, 'electric', 5, 250)
tesla_model_s.make_noise() # VRUUUUUUUM
```

### Exercise
Write a student class (Name, Mark) with one method which return if the student pass/fail the test (mark >=? 10)
