# ML
An agent is learning if it improves its performance on future tasks after making observations
about the world.

There are three types of feedback that determine the three main types of learning:
- unsupervised learning: the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied.
- reinforcement learning: the agent learns from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.
- supervised learning: the agent observes some example input–output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output.
