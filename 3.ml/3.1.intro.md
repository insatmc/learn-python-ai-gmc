Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

There are three types of feedback that determine the three main types of learning:
- unsupervised learning: the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied.
- reinforcement learning: the agent learns from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.
- supervised learning: the agent observes some example input–output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output.
