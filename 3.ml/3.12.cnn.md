# Convolutional Neural Networks

A ConvNet architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume

There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)

Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function

Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)

Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

## Convolutional Layer
The Conv layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Network that does most of the computational heavy lifting.

## Pooling Layer

It is common to periodically insert a Pooling layer in-between successive Conv layers in a ConvNet architecture. Its function is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting
