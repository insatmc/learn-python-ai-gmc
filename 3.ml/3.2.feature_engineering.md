# Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning.

## The process of feature engineering
* Brainstorming or Testing features
* Deciding what features to create
* Creating features
* Checking how the features work with your model
* Improving your features if needed
* Go back to brainstorming/creating more features until the work is done.

## Exercise
Analyse some of the datasets from Kaggle.
