### List: Collection | Array
```python
my_integers = [5, 7, 3, 4, 4]
```

To take an element of the array and manipulate it we use indexes like this
```python
print(my_integers[0]) # 5
print(my_integers[1] + my_integers[4]) # 7 + 4 = 11
```

To add an element to our list we use append()
```python
bookshelf = []
bookshelf.append("The Effective Engineer")
bookshelf.append("The 4 Hour Work Week")
print(bookshelf[0]) # The Effective Engineer
print(bookshelf[1]) # The 4 Hour Work Week
```

### Tuples
Lists that cannot be changed, just another thing () in place of [].

```python
  a = (1, 2, "string", [])
  print(a[2])
```
