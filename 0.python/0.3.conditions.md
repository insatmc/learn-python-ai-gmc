# Control Flow: conditional statements
If a condition is True do something otherwise do another thing else.


```python
if 1 > 2:
  print("1 is greater than 2")
else:
  print("1 is not greater than 2")
```

You can also use “elif” statement. Like that:

```python
if 1 > 2:
  print("1 is greater than 2")
elif 2 > 1:
  print("1 is not greater than 2")
else:
  print("1 is equal to 2")
```
