## Indexing
As we did see we can access an element with it's (row, col) combination, numpy has other cool method to access elements:

```python
a = np.array([2, 3, 4, 1])
a[a>=2] = 2
```

## Handling non-existing values
```python
c = np.array([1, 2, np.NAN, 3, 4])
c[np.isnan(c)] =  np.mean(c[~np.isnan(c)])
```
