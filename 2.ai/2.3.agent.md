An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and
acting upon that environment through actuators.

###  Simple reflex agents
```ruby
function SIMPLE_REFLEX_AGENT(percept) returns an action
  persistent: rules, a set of condition–action rules

  state ← INTERPRET_INPUT(percept)
  rule ← RULE_MATCH(state, rules)
  action ← rule.ACTION
  return action
```
