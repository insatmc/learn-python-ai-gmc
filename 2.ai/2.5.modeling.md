### Modeling

A problem can be defined formally by five components:
- The <b>initial state</b> that the agent starts in.

- A description of the <b>possible actions</b> available to the agent. Given a particular state s,
ACTIONS(s) returns the set of actions that can be executed in s. We say that each of
APPLICABLE these actions is applicable in s.

- A description of what each action does; the formal name for this is the transition
model.

- The goal test, which determines whether a given state is a goal state.

- A path cost function that assigns a numeric cost to each path. The problem-solving
agent chooses a cost function that reflects its own performance measure.

### Example: The vacuum world

- States: The state is determined by both the agent location and the dirt locations. The
agent is in one of two locations, each of which might or might not contain dirt.
- Initial state: Any state can be designated as the initial state
- Actions: In this simple environment, each state has just three actions: Left, Right, and
Suck.
- Transition model: The actions have their expected effects, except that moving Left in
the leftmost square, moving Right in the rightmost square, and Sucking in a clean square
have no effect.
- Goal test: This checks whether all the squares are clean.
- Path cost: Each step costs 1, so the path cost is the number of steps in the path.
