# Solving problem by searching

We will use example of solving the problem of going from place Arad to place Bucharest:

We start from the root element "Arad" then we expand our state with the possible actions: "Sibiu", "Timisoara" and "Zerind"

Each new node is called a "leaf" we test now if we get to our goal, if not we expand the state more and more until we get to our goal.

Another point we need to be careful of redundant paths.

## Greedy best-first tree search
Select leaf with best cost to get to our goal

## A* search: Minimizing the total estimated solution cost

A* evaluates nodes by combining g(n), the cost to reach the node, and h(n), the cost
to get from the node to the goal:

# Let's code:
Write in python a function that use A* search to find a path from city 1 to city 2.
