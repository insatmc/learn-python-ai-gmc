# AI
We -human- have for thousands of years tried to understand how we think.
AI goes with idea one step further, with AI we want to create intelligence.


## The Turing Test approach
* The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed to provide a satisfactory
operational definition of intelligence.
* A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after
posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person
or from a computer.
