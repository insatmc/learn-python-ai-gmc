## Problems that we want to solve with AI
The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.
- Reasoning, problem solving
- Knowledge representation
- Planning
- Learning
- Natural language processing

Harder goals that we are far from achieving:
- Creativity
- General intelligence
