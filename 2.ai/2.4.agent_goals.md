#  Goal-based agents
Knowing something about the current state of the environment is not always enough to decide what to do.

For example, at a road junction, the taxi can turn left, turn right, or go straight on. The correct decision depends on where the taxi is trying to get to.

In other words, as well GOAL as a current state description, the agent needs some sort of goal information that describes situations that are desirable—for example, being at the passenger’s destination. The agent
program can combine this with the model (the same information as was used in the model-based reflex agent) to choose actions that achieve the goal.
